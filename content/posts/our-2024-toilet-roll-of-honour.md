Welcome to the Toilet Map blog! We’re kicking off with a wrap of the year, to thank our contributors for every edit and give you a little insight into how the Toilet Map keeps up-to-date. 

**First, some stats.**

# New toilets: 

We've had **854 toilets** added to the Toilet Map this year, with another 800 updates of toilets we already show. 

That’s amazing!

# Website Visits:

**396000 of you** have visited the Toilet Map this year. 

That’s 40% more than 2023, we’re on a (toilet) roll!

**Who’s really been winning in 2024?**

# 2024 Council of the year **(most updates to toilet data)**

## **London Borough of Tower Hamlets**

Kudos to London Borough of Tower Hamlets who are using the Toilet Map to support their new Community Toilet Scheme (CTS), pipping CTS veterans London Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames to the crown. 

Toilet mapping activity has covered the British Isles, right up to the 15 newly mapped loos on the Shetland Islands. 

Special kudos to the person/s who added and updated 39 toilets on **Guernsey & Sark** back in April - one of our biggest updates and outside of our local area boundaries so not caught by our search - it nearly snuck through! Locals and holidaymakers alike will be very grateful.

Edits may have been made by a member of the public, a council officer, as part of someone else’s job, or occasionally by us on the council’s behalf (current rate: flattery)

Here are the ten council areas with the most updates (new loo, edit or removal) in 2024 (new toilets only in brackets)

1. London Borough of Tower Hamlets: 88 (46)     
2. London Borough of Richmond upon Thames: 81 (47)   
3. Dumfries and Galloway Council: 73 (24)
4. Argyll and Bute Council: 64 (15)
5. Birmingham City Council: 50 (15)    
6. Westminster City Council: 46 (21)       
7. London Borough of Southwark: 35 (21)     
8. Wiltshire Council: 31 (15)       
9. Allerdale Borough Council: 30 (15)      
10. Shetland Islands: 29 (15)

## **Trafalgar Square** Public Toilets (4.1K hits)

No surprises here as the map defaults to Trafalgar Square in London if it doesn’t know your location. But why Trafalgar Square? 

Well, London is instantly recognisable due to our familiarity with the place names, helping visitors to orientate themselves. And Trafalgar Square is special in both mapping and toilets. 

Why? Here are some fun facts:

* Distances to/from London are measured from Trafalgar Square - specifically, the traffic island to the south of Nelson’s Column, a 6-way junction known as ‘Charing Cross’.
* This used to be the location of the final Eleanor Cross, a series of monuments positioned down the East of England. The monument still exists, and is now located outside Charing Cross Station. 
* The loos at Trafalgar Square are a huge set of public toilets, and the only ones managed by the Mayor of London (not personally), if we ignore for a moment TfL loos and those at City Hall. They were built as part of the Square’s redevelopment and pedestrianisation in 2003. 

Those around Parliament - are more likely in the top 10 due to the massive visitor demand. But watch out - Westminster Underground Station toilets on Parliament Street are currently closed for much needed redevelopment.
