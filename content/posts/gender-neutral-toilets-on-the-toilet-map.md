At the Toilet Map, we’re saddened by the Supreme Court’s rulings around single-sex spaces, and the implications for transgender and non-binary people’s access to toilets. Our whole project is about helping people to find toilets that meet their needs, so we can all get out, meet up, explore, work, love, play, and generally live our best lives, even if we need a wee. That challenge has become that bit harder, when transgender and non-binary people are made to feel they have less right to access toilets than others, spaces they’ve used their whole lives.

This exclusion from toilets that aligned with someone’s gender was repeated by Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson, who added,

"I know that many businesses large and small will ensure that they have appropriate provision in place, for example many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate cubicles that can be used by anyone."

Let’s set aside for now that the previous government introduced a new Building Regulation to stop a move towards unisex provision, requiring all new non-domestic buildings to have single-sex toilets, with gender-neutral loos as an optional extra if space remains. This has enshrined exclusion in regulation, which, as inclusive designers and developers, we are fundamental against.

Is the Minister right? How many publicly-accessible toilets have gender-neutral (unisex) provision?

The Toilet Map has collected data on gender-neutral toilets for the last five years (toilets in general for ten). Of the 15133 publicly-accessible toilets in our dataset (as of Sept 24), we have information on gender-neutral toilets for 18% of these (2675 toilets). Within this data, 54% of toilet locations include a gender-neutral toilet (1447 toilets), and 46% do not (1227 toilets).

If people are to rely on gender-neutral toilets alone, access to toilets halves. By way of comparison, babies have better provision - our data shows 66% of publicly accessible toilets have a baby-changing table, 34% do not.

Significantly for our project, our data around baby-changing is also much more complete - we have information about baby-changing provision for 45% of our toilets. That’s still more than half where we don’t have the info, but it’s much better than our records for gender-neutral provision. For four out of five toilets, we just don’t know.

Why? It’s partly because we’ve been collecting baby-changing data for twice as long. It’s also because a website or map will say if baby-changing is provided. Websites don’t say if there’s a gender-neutral toilet. For that, we need YOU! - people who visit toilets, know toilets, maybe provide toilets, to add these details and keep building a toilet map that helps so many.

We try to minimise the amount of data we ask for about each toilet, to make it easy for people to add missing loos and keep the map up to date. The info we ask for focuses on the essentials - the details that will determine whether someone will be able to use this toilet, before they go out of their way to find it. Is there a wheelchair-accessible toilet? Will we need to pay? Is it even open at this time?

And we decided that ‘is a gender-neutral toilet?’ might be important info for people to know about, when searching for a toilet. It is a toilet you can use with your child, so you’re not separated, worrying they might have wandered off whilst you’re still stuck in the queue. It’s a toilet where you can accompany a friend or family member who you can be on hand for a friend or relative who may need help because they’re injured, or unwell, or anxious. And yes, it’s a toilet you can use without fearing being questioned, harassed or worse because of gender-based abuse.

What is a gender-neutral toilet? We use this term to mean any standard toilet that can be used by anyone, regardless of gender. Unisex is another term. We could just say ‘toilet’, because when sex or gender no longer signifies who the toilet is for, that’s all it is. We don’t include the (wheelchair-)accessible toilet unless this is the only loo available, like in a coffee shop (but we ask ‘is there an accessible toilet?’ separately, which have always been gender-neutral without any problems). The gender-neutral toilet may be the only loo, it may be a whole bank of loos, it may be in addition to single-sex toilets. We don’t know\* - but we know that it exists. For everyone.

\*A note on gender-neutral toilet design. Most gender-neutral toilets are toilets anyone will feel comfortable using, without needing to know more about the specific design; floor-to-ceiling walls, sometimes a basin. In fact, the vast majority of gender-neutral toilets will meet the design requirements of a wheelchair-accessible toilet, in places where this is the only loo provided.

There are a few gender-neutral toilets that create more confusing environments - where everyone is using old-style cubicles without as much audio or visual privacy as we might like. In the UK, we’re not used to men and women using these toilets alongside each other, and it can be uncomfortable for some, to the point of avoidance. However there aren’t many publicly accessible toilets of this design (I can’t think of any, just a few in relaxed, experimental settings, like bars, clubs or theatres). Where this is the case, we invite people to use the notes field, so people can decide in advance if this is a toilet they’re able to use.
