              Everyone will, at some point in the day, need to use the toilet.
              Some people will need facilities more than others, and some will
              need to find toilets sooner rather than later.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Toilet Map aims to be a complete, up-to-date, sustainable
              source of toilet locations. It&apos;s the UK&apos;s largest
              database of publicly-accessible toilets (see below), with over
              14,000 facilities.

            <p>
              The Toilet Map is run by Public Convenience, a joint venture
              between researchers Dr Jo-Anne Bichard and Gail Ramster (who
              created the map at the RCA Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design) and
              software development company{' '}

              Publicly Accessible Toilets
            </h2>
            <p>
              The project aims to map all publicly-accessible toilets - that
              means all toilets that the public can access without needing to be
              a customer.
            </p>
            <p>This includes: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>public toilets</li>
              <li>
                toilets in train stations, bus stations, service/petrol
                stations, tube stations, ferry terminals, airports and other
                transport networks
              </li>
              <li>shopping centre toilets</li>
              <li>
                toilets in public buildings, such as town halls, libraries,
                hospitals, museums and leisure centres
              </li>
              <li>
                toilets in other businesses where the business agrees that the
                public can use their toilets without having to buy anything.
                These are often part of Community Toilet Schemes (run by
                councils) and can include shops, cafes, supermarkets,
                restaurants, hotels and pubs.
              </li>
              <li>
                We try not to show toilets where you need to ask permission to
                use it, such as those that are for customers-only. The exception
                is platform-side toilets at stations. These are only accessible
                to ticket-holders but we feel it is still useful information,
                particularly when many trains donâ€™t have toilets onboard.
              </li>
            </ul>
