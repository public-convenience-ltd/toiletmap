          The Great British Public Toilet Map is a website to help people find
          toilets across the UK. It is the UK's largest database of
          publicly-accessible toilets, with over 11000 facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone will, at some point in the day, need to use the toilet. Some
          people will need facilities more than others, and some will need to
          find toilets sooner rather than later.
        </p>

          The Great British Public Toilet Map aims to be a complete, up-to-date,
          sustainable source of toilet locations. It's the UK's largest database
          of publicly-accessible toilets (see below), with over 11000
          facilities.

          The Great British Public Toilet Map is run by Public Convenience, a
          joint venture between researchers Dr Jo-Anne Bichard and Gail Ramster
          (who created the map at the RCA Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design) and
          software development company{' '}

          The project aims to map all publicly-accessible toilets - that means
          all toilets that the public can access without needing to be a
          customer.

            toilets in other businesses where the business agrees that the
            public can use their toilets without having to buy anything. These
            are often part of Community Toilet Schemes (run by councils) and can
            include shops, cafes, supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and pubs.

            We try not to show toilets where you need to ask permission to use
            it, such as those that are for customers-only. The exception is
            platform-side toilets at stations. These are only accessible to
            ticket-holders but we feel it is still useful information,
            particularly when many trains don’t have toilets onboard.
