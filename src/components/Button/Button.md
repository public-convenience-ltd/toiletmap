### Primary

```jsx
<Button>Click me!</Button>
```

### Secondary

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary">Click me!</Button>
```

### Link

The most common use can would be combine the `link` variant with `as="a"` to render the component as an anchor element.

```jsx
<Button as="a" href="" variant="link">
  Click me!
</Button>
```
