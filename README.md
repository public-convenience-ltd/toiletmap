## What is the Toilet Map?

Everyone will, at some point in the day, need to use the toilet. Some people will need facilities more than others, and some will need to find toilets sooner rather than later.

The Great British Public Toilet Map aims to be a complete, up-to-date, sustainable source of toilet locations. It's the UK's largest database of publicly-accessible toilets, with over 14,000 facilities.

The project is completely open source and is supported by a fantastic set of [Sponsors](#sponsors) who help us make the service as good as it can possibly be.

This documentation is oriented towards developers, if you'd like to learn more about our data and how to access it please refer to [Toilet Map Explorer](https://www.toiletmap.org.uk/explorer).

## Getting Started

The following is a "quick start" guide aimed at getting you started with a development environment to start hacking on the map. If you'd like to configure Auth0 for local authentication or run our end to end tests locally please take a look at our more in-depth [setup](./docs/setup.md) documentation.

### Prerequisites

- [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (or a node version matching the one specified in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc))
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to spin up a local postgres database to develop against.
- Vercel CLI (optional)

### Installation

_Clone or download and unpack the project and change into its directory and then use your favourite node version manager to switch to the version defined in our `.nvmrc`. We use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) as a demonstration, although alternative are available such as `asdf` and `nvm`:_

```
fnm use
```

_Now we install the dependencies using the `pnpm` package manager:_

```
pnpm install
```

### Run, Toiletmap, Run

First we need a set of local environment variables:

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Next you'll need to set up a local instance of Postgres based on our mocked loo data. This is so that you can load something on your local instance of the Toilet Map. We use the Supabase development container to spin up a local version of the same platform that we currently use in stage and production.

> **Note**
> It's also possible to connect directly to our staging database, although you'll need to ask for those credentials should you need them.

```
pnpm supabase:start
```

When you run this command, 5000 mock toilets and UK area boundaries will be loaded from [seed.sql](./supabase/seed.sql). The loos in use here are pre-generated using faker.js in [generateMocks.ts](./scripts/generateMocks.ts).

Because the faker generation is set with a static seed, the values remain the same between generations. This is important, because we depend upon the values remaining the same in our [cypress tests](./cypress/e2e//desktop/index.cy.ts) so we have a deterministic set of data to rely upon across our test runs.

Once you have a local Postgres instance running you'll then be able to spin up a local development server using the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

If all is well, upon navigation to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you will be presented with your very own instance of the Toilet Map that is connected to the local Postgres database that you have just set up.

If you'd like to make contributions to the project this is a good time to read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/neontribe/gbptm/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [code of conduct](https://github.com/neontribe/gbptm/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Architecture

The Toilet Map UI is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The API is written in GraphQL with [GraphQL Yoga Server](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga) and data is stored in a Postgres database hosted by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). We connect to the database through the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM. Authentication is handled by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and the site is deployed to [vercel](https://vercel.com)
